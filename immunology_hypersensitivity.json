          "answer": "Mast cells and basophils",
          "explanation": "Upon allergen exposure, IgE cross-links on mast cells and basophils, leading to histamine release."

          "question": "Which immune cells mediate Type IV hypersensitivity?",
          "options": ["B cells", "T lymphocytes", "Neutrophils", "Eosinophils"],
          "answer": "T lymphocytes",
          "explanation": "Type IV is driven by CD4+ Th1 and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, not antibodies."
