                    "explanation": "The D antigen is the most important antigen in the Rh blood group system. Its presence on the surface of red blood cells makes a person Rh-positive (Rh+), while its absence makes them Rh-negative (Rh-)."

                    "explanation": "A person with Rh-positive blood has the D antigen present on the surface of their red blood cells. Since their body recognizes the D antigen as 'self,' they do not produce the anti-D antibody."

However, it will sensitize the patient's immune system, causing it to produce anti-D antibodies. A subsequent transfusion of Rh-positive blood would then trigger a delayed but severe hemolytic reaction."

                    "explanation": "To prevent sensitization and the formation of anti-D antibodies, it is crucial that Rh-negative individuals only receive blood from other Rh-negative donors. This ensures that no D antigens are introduced into their bloodstream."

                    "explanation": "HDN due to Rh incompatibility occurs when an Rh-negative mother is carrying an Rh-positive fetus. During childbirth or other events, fetal red blood cells may enter the mother's circulation, causing her to become sensitized and produce anti-D antibodies that can cross the placenta in a subsequent pregnancy and attack the fetus's red blood cells."

                    "explanation": "RhoGAM is an injection of anti-D antibodies. When given to an Rh-negative mother, it binds to any fetal Rh-positive red blood cells that may have entered her bloodstream, destroying them before her own immune system can recognize the antigens and produce its own long-lasting anti-D antibodies."

                    "explanation": "The D allele is dominant over the 'd' allele. Therefore, a person who inherits one of each (Dd) will still express the D antigen on their red blood cells and will be classified as Rh-positive."

                    "explanation": "The anti-D antibody is an immune antibody and is primarily of the IgG class. Unlike the IgM antibodies of the ABO system, IgG antibodies are small enough to cross the placenta from mother to fetus, which is why they are responsible for causing HDN."

                    "explanation": "For the Rh system, Rh-negative blood is considered the universal donor. This is because its red blood cells lack the D antigen, so they will not trigger an immune response from a recipient's pre-existing anti-D antibodies."

                    "explanation": "ABO reactions are immediate because anti-A and anti-B antibodies are naturally present in plasma. Rh reactions, on the other hand, are typically delayed because the patient must first be sensitized by a prior exposure to form the anti-D antibody. The reaction only occurs upon subsequent exposure to the D antigen."

Therefore, a confirmatory test, the IAT, is performed.

                    "explanation": "The $D_{el}$ phenotype is an extremely weak D variant. The RHD gene is present and functional, but a point mutation leads to an incredibly low number of D antigen sites on the red cell surface (as few as 10-30 per cell). The D antigen cannot be detected by standard serological methods, including the IAT. Its presence is confirmed only by advanced adsorption-elution studies using a high-titer anti-D antibody."

                    "answer": "Rh-negative for all purposes.",
                    "explanation": "Due to the extremely low number of D antigen sites, a $D_{el}$ individual is highly unlikely to produce a significant anti-D antibody in response to an Rh-positive transfusion. However, the $D_{el}$ antigen is sufficiently immunogenic to sensitize an Rh-negative recipient. Therefore, for transfusion, they are considered Rh-positive donors. For their own clinical management, they should be treated as Rh-negative recipients and Rh-negative pregnant women to prevent alloimmunization and subsequent HDN."

The RHCE gene is responsible for the expression of the Cc and Ee antigens. The specific antigens expressed (e.g., C, c, E, or e) are determined by the specific alleles present on the RHCE gene."

                    "explanation": "The $Rh_{mod}$ phenotype is a weakened version of the $Rh_{null}$ phenotype. It is caused by a hypomorphic mutation in the RHAG gene, which leads to a partial loss of function. This results in a significantly reduced, but not completely absent, expression of all Rh antigens (D, C, c, E, e) on the red cell surface. This condition is also associated with a mild hemolytic anemia."

The safest and most effective transfusion strategy is to simply provide Rh-negative blood, which lacks the D antigen entirely and thus poses no risk of a reaction from the pre-existing anti-D antibody."

This gene has several point mutations and insertions that render it non-functional and unable to produce a D antigen. This genetic difference has important implications for molecular Rh typing."

A partial D patient's red cells will react with some of the anti-D reagents but not others, indicating that certain epitopes are missing. In contrast, a weak D patient's red cells will react, albeit weakly, with all of the anti-D reagents."

                    "explanation": "An acquired B antigen is a serological discrepancy, not a genetic change. It occurs most often in patients with colorectal cancer or gastrointestinal infections. A bacterial enzyme, such as a deacetylase, removes the acetyl group from the N-acetylgalactosamine terminal sugar of the A antigen. This modified sugar is then structurally similar to the galactose of the B antigen, causing the red cells to react with anti-B typing sera."

                    "answer": "She should be managed as Rh-negative and receive RhoGAM.",
                    "explanation": "Because a weak D woman can be sensitized by a complete D antigen from an Rh-positive fetus, it is the standard of care to manage her as if she were Rh-negative. This includes the administration of RhoGAM at 28 weeks of gestation and again postpartum to prevent the formation of anti-D antibodies that could harm a subsequent pregnancy."

As a result, the individual's immune system recognizes all Rh antigens as foreign. They may produce a potent antibody (often called anti-Rh29 or anti-Rh50) that reacts with all Rh-positive and Rh-negative blood.

It is encoded by the KEL gene on chromosome 7, and its protein product is a transmembrane glycoprotein.

                    "explanation": "Compound antigens are not simple aggregates of separate antigens. They are novel epitopes formed by the conformational change of the Rh protein when two specific alleles (e.g., $c$ and $e$) are present on the same chromosome (in cis). The $f$ antigen is a classic example, as it is only present when the $c$ and $e$ alleles are inherited in a cis haplotype."

A high maternal antibody titer and the presence of potent IgG subclasses (e.g., IgG1 and IgG3) indicate a high risk of severe fetal red cell destruction and a higher likelihood of hydrops fetalis.

It simply means that if an antibody is present, its concentration (titer) is too low to be detected by the screening test. This can happen early in a primary immune response.

                        "A delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction.",

                    "explanation": "A positive DAT indicates that red blood cells are coated with antibodies in vivo. In a patient who has a weak D antigen, this is a strong indication of an underlying autoimmune condition. The patient's immune system is mistakenly producing an antibody against its own Rh antigen, which is then binding to the surface of the red blood cells and leading to a positive DAT and potential hemolysis."

                        "The blood must be irradiated.",
                        "The risk of a delayed hemolytic reaction if the donor unit contains the target antigen.",

                    "answer": "The risk of a delayed hemolytic reaction if the donor unit contains the target antigen.",
                    "explanation": "A known rare alloantibody is a red flag for transfusion medicine. If the patient is transfused with a unit that contains the corresponding antigen, the pre-existing alloantibody will target the donor red cells for destruction, leading to a delayed hemolytic reaction. The most significant concern is finding a compatible unit that is completely negative for the antigen to which the patient has been sensitized."

                    "explanation": "The weak D phenotype, while having a reduced expression of the D antigen, can still be immunogenic. If a pregnant woman with this phenotype is carrying a fetus with a complete D antigen, there is a risk that she could become sensitized and produce a clinically significant anti-D antibody. This antibody would then pose a risk to the current or a future pregnancy, making it critical to manage all weak D pregnancies as if they were Rh-negative."
