                    "answer": "Chromosome 9",
                    "explanation": "The gene that codes for the ABO blood group antigens is located on the long arm of chromosome 9 (9q34.2). This gene, formally known as the ABO gene, encodes a glycosyltransferase enzyme that is responsible for adding specific sugar residues to the H antigen on the red blood cell surface, thereby creating the A and B antigens."

                    ],
                    "answer": "Alpha-D-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase",
                    "explanation": "The A allele codes for a specific glycosyltransferase enzyme called alpha-D-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase. This enzyme adds an N-acetylgalactosamine sugar residue to the terminal galactose of the H antigen's carbohydrate chain, which modifies it to become the A antigen."

                        "It determines the Rh factor.",
                        "It serves as the precursor substance for A and B antigens.",
                        "It is responsible for blood clotting.",

                    ],
                    "answer": "It serves as the precursor substance for A and B antigens.",
                    "explanation": "The H antigen, synthesized by the H gene (FUT1), is the foundational carbohydrate structure upon which the A and B antigens are built. The A and B alleles' glycosyltransferase enzymes can only modify this H antigen. Without a functional H gene, the A and B alleles cannot be expressed, leading to the rare Bombay phenotype."

                    ],
                    "answer": "They will have no A, B, or H antigens and possess anti-A, anti-B, and anti-H antibodies.",
                    "explanation": "The Bombay phenotype is a rare condition caused by a homozygous recessive mutation in the H gene (hh). Since the H antigen is the precursor for A and B antigens, a person with this genotype will not express any A, B, or H antigens on their red blood cells. Consequently, their plasma will contain naturally occurring anti-A, anti-B, and, most importantly, anti-H antibodies. This means they can only receive blood from other individuals with the Bombay phenotype."

                    "answer": "IgM",
                    "explanation": "The naturally occurring anti-A and anti-B antibodies in a person's plasma are predominantly of the IgM class. IgM antibodies are large pentameric molecules that are highly efficient at causing agglutination (clumping) and complement activation, leading to a rapid and severe acute hemolytic transfusion reaction upon an ABO mismatch."

                        "A1 is a common allele, while A2 is a rare mutation.",
                        "A2 is a dominant allele over A1."
                    ],
                    "answer": "A2 is a weaker variant of A, with fewer A antigens expressed on the red cell surface.",
                    "explanation": "The A blood type is subdivided into A1 and A2, with A1 being more common (approximately 80% of type A individuals). The A1 allele produces a more active glycosyltransferase, leading to a high density of A antigens on the red blood cell. The A2 allele produces a less efficient enzyme, resulting in fewer A antigens and often some unexpressed H antigens. This can sometimes lead to the development of an 'anti-A1' antibody in an A2 person, which would cause a reaction if they received A1 blood."

                    "question": "A patient is a 'non-secretor.' This means they lack a functional FUT2 gene. What is the clinical implication?",
                    "options": [
                        "They cannot produce the H antigen.",
                        "They cannot express A, B, or H antigens in body fluids like saliva.",

                    "answer": "They cannot express A, B, or H antigens in body fluids like saliva.",
                    "explanation": "The FUT2 gene, or secretor gene (Se), determines whether a person can express ABO blood group antigens in their body fluids (secretions). A person who is a 'non-secretor' (genotype se/se) lacks a functional FUT2 gene and therefore cannot express these antigens in their saliva, tears, or semen. This has been linked to susceptibility to certain bacterial and viral infections, as some pathogens use these antigens as binding sites."

                    "answer": "ABO incompatibility",
                    "explanation": "An acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (AHTR) is a medical emergency characterized by rapid red blood cell destruction. The most common cause of AHTR is a clerical or procedural error resulting in the transfusion of ABO-incompatible blood. This triggers an immediate, massive immune response due to the pre-existing, potent IgM anti-A or anti-B antibodies in the recipient's plasma."

                    "answer": "BB or BO",
                    "explanation": "Blood type B is determined by the presence of at least one dominant B allele. Therefore, a person can have either two B alleles (homozygous dominant, genotype BB) or one B allele and one recessive O allele (heterozygous, genotype BO)."

                    "answer": "Testing the patient's red cells for antigens using known antibodies.",
                    "explanation": "Forward typing is the standard method for determining a person's blood type. It involves mixing the patient's red blood cells with commercially prepared anti-A and anti-B sera (known antibodies). Agglutination (clumping) indicates the presence of the corresponding antigen on the red blood cell surface."

                    "answer": "Type O",
                    "explanation": "Forward typing is a direct test for antigens. The lack of agglutination when the patient's red blood cells are mixed with both anti-A and anti-B sera means that their red blood cells possess neither the A nor the B antigen, which is the defining characteristic of blood type O."

                    "answer": "Type O",
                    "explanation": "Epidemiological studies have shown that individuals with blood type O have a higher incidence of gastric ulcers caused by H. pylori. Conversely, individuals with blood type A have a lower risk. The mechanism is thought to be related to the specific adhesion molecules and carbohydrate structures that H. pylori uses to bind to gastric mucosa."

                    "answer": "Gradual decrease in hemoglobin and jaundice.",
                    "explanation": "Unlike the immediate reaction from an ABO mismatch, a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction typically occurs 3 to 10 days after a transfusion. It is caused by a low concentration of recipient IgG antibodies (often from prior sensitization) that slowly destroy the transfused red blood cells, leading to symptoms like a gradual drop in hemoglobin (anemia) and jaundice due to bilirubin accumulation."

                    "answer": "They are glycoproteins or glycolipids.",
                    "explanation": "Blood group antigens in the ABO system are carbohydrate molecules (oligosaccharides) that are attached to proteins (glycoproteins) or lipids (glycolipids) on the surface of the red blood cell membrane. This carbohydrate structure, or epitope, is what determines the antigen's specificity."

                    "explanation": "Platelets do express some ABO antigens, but a reaction is less common than with red blood cells. However, platelet concentrates are suspended in donor plasma. If the donor's plasma contains high titers of anti-A or anti-B antibodies, these antibodies can cause a mild hemolytic reaction in the recipient. Therefore, ABO-identical or compatible platelet transfusions are preferred to avoid this complication."

This leads to a change in the amino acid at codon 176 from Leucine to Proline. This minor change is sufficient to significantly reduce the efficiency of the $A_2$ glycosyltransferase enzyme compared to the $A_1$ enzyme. Consequently, $A_2$ red cells express far fewer A antigen sites and contain unexpressed H antigen sites, which can lead to the formation of a weak anti-$A_1$ antibody in some individuals."

                    "explanation": "The acquired B antigen is very labile. A simple acid-treatment of the patient's red blood cells can neutralize this antigen, causing the 'B' agglutination to disappear. This is a key distinguishing feature from a true B antigen, which is not affected by acid treatment. A positive acid elution test confirms the presence of an acquired B antigen."

                    "explanation": "A severe AHTR due to an ABO mismatch triggers the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and exposes phospholipid surfaces from the destroyed red blood cells. This can activate the coagulation cascade throughout the body, leading to widespread microthrombi formation and the consumption of platelets and clotting factors. This is a life-threatening complication known as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which can cause both widespread bleeding and organ damage."

                    "explanation": "An antibody screen is designed to detect 'unexpected' alloantibodies from blood group systems other than ABO. A patient with blood type B is expected to have anti-A antibodies, so a positive screen would not be caused by them. Instead, it indicates the presence of an antibody formed from a previous exposure, such as anti-D from a prior pregnancy or transfusion. Identifying this antibody is critical for preventing a future transfusion reaction."

                    "explanation": "The cis-AB phenotype is caused by a single gene inherited from one parent that has the capacity to produce both the A and B glycosyltransferases. This is not a fusion gene in the classical sense but a complex series of point mutations and deletions that result in a hybrid enzyme with a broad specificity, allowing it to produce both A and B antigens from the H antigen substrate. This is a very rare genetic event that violates standard Mendelian inheritance patterns."

This simple rule explains why a person with blood type A has anti-B antibodies, and a person with blood type B has anti-A antibodies. This rule is the fundamental basis for the forward and reverse typing methods used to ensure safe blood transfusions."
