      ],
      "answer": "It promotes the release of endogenous $vWF$ and Factor VIII from storage sites.",
      "explanation": "$DDAVP$ is an analog of vasopressin that stimulates the release of $vWF$ and Factor VIII from the Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells, thus temporarily raising their circulating levels."
