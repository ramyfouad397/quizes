          "answer": "IgE against plasma proteins",
          "explanation": "IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to donor plasma proteins causes allergic transfusion reactions, usually with rash and pruritus."

          "answer": "Febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions",
          "explanation": "Leukoreduction removes donor WBCs, decreasing cytokine accumulation and FNHTRs."

          "question": "What is the usual management of mild allergic transfusion reactions?",
          "options": ["Stop transfusion permanently", "Give antihistamines and restart if symptoms resolve", "Start steroids", "Exchange transfusion"],
          "answer": "Give antihistamines and restart if symptoms resolve",
          "explanation": "Most mild allergic reactions resolve with antihistamines and do not require discarding the blood unit."

          "answer": "IgA-deficient patients",
          "explanation": "IgA-deficient patients can develop anti-IgA antibodies and experience life-threatening anaphylaxis upon transfusion."

          "answer": "5–14 days",
          "explanation": "DHTRs usually appear 5–14 days after transfusion as antibody titers rise."

          "question": "Which antibody class most often causes delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions?",
          "options": ["IgM", "IgG", "IgE", "IgD"],
          "answer": "IgG",
          "explanation": "IgG alloantibodies (often against Kidd, Duffy, Kell antigens) cause extravascular hemolysis in DHTRs."

          "answer": "TRALI",
          "explanation": "Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is caused by donor anti-HLA or anti-neutrophil antibodies causing pulmonary edema."
