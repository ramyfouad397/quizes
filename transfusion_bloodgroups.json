          "options": ["Maternal anemia", "Neonatal hemolytic disease", "Preeclampsia", "Gestational diabetes"],
          "answer": "Neonatal hemolytic disease",
          "explanation": "If an Rh-negative mother is exposed to Rh-positive fetal blood, she may form anti-D antibodies that destroy fetal RBCs."

        {
          "question": "Which prophylactic treatment prevents hemolytic disease of the newborn due to Rh incompatibility?",
          "options": ["Anti-A serum", "Anti-D immunoglobulin", "Plasmapheresis", "Blood transfusion"],
          "answer": "Anti-D immunoglobulin",
          "explanation": "Rh-negative mothers receive anti-D immunoglobulin to prevent sensitization to the Rh D antigen."

          "question": "What type of antibody is typically responsible for Rh incompatibility reactions?",
          "options": ["IgM", "IgA", "IgE", "IgG"],
          "answer": "IgG",
          "explanation": "Unlike ABO, which is mediated by IgM, Rh antibodies are IgG and can cross the placenta to affect the fetus."

        {
          "question": "Which laboratory test is used to detect antibodies in the serum of pregnant women?",
          "options": ["Direct Coombs test", "Indirect Coombs test", "Skin prick test", "ELISA only"],
          "answer": "Indirect Coombs test",
          "explanation": "The indirect Coombs test detects free antibodies in the motherâ€™s serum that can bind to fetal RBCs."

          "options": ["Kell system", "Lewis system", "MNS system", "Duffy system"],
          "answer": "Kell system",
          "explanation": "The Kell system is clinically significant and can cause severe hemolytic transfusion reactions."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which antigen provides resistance to malaria infection?",
          "options": ["Kell antigen", "Lewis antigen", "Duffy antigen", "Kidd antigen"],
          "answer": "Duffy antigen",
          "explanation": "Duffy negative individuals are resistant to Plasmodium vivax infection, as the parasite uses this antigen as a receptor."

          "question": "Which blood group system antigen is expressed on glycophorins of RBC membranes?",
          "options": ["MNS system", "Lewis system", "Kidd system", "Kell system"],
          "answer": "MNS system",
          "explanation": "The M and N antigens are located on glycophorins of red blood cells in the MNS blood group system."

        {
          "question": "The Kidd blood group system is important because:",
          "options": ["It prevents HIV infection", "It causes delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions", "It determines ABO compatibility", "It is only found in neonates"],
          "answer": "It causes delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions",
          "explanation": "Kidd antibodies are notorious for causing delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions as they can disappear and reappear with re-exposure."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which blood group antigen is unique because it is not synthesized by RBCs but secreted into plasma and adsorbed onto RBC surface?",
          "options": ["Lewis antigen", "Duffy antigen", "MNS antigen", "Kell antigen"],
          "answer": "Lewis antigen",
          "explanation": "Lewis antigens are secreted in plasma and secondarily adsorbed onto the red cell surface, unlike other intrinsic blood group antigens."
